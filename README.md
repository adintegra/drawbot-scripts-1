# DrawBot scripts

Python scripts to be used in [DrawBot](http://drawbot.readthedocs.org)

- `drawCircularChart.py` (quick and dirty) draws fancy circular charts with proportional sections, see [an example at the bottom of this page](https://www.rosettatype.com/blog/2016/02/02/Skolar-Sans-Pan-European)
- `visualizeCommitHistory.py` visualizes commit history in a colour-coded graph (one colour per contributor) with years and project milestones as labels, see [an example at the bottom of this page](https://www.rosettatype.com/blog/2016/02/02/Skolar-Sans-Pan-European)
